# **Customer Support**

In this Customer Support application, we've send mail notification to the Customers and Coordinators while creating, assigning, closing and even in some specific scenarios.

- **Ticket Create -** When the customer `create a new ticket`, the ticket create mail notification will send it to the created `customer and the relevant coordinator.`

- **Assign -** When the ticket is `pickup or assign` to the user, the `user will receive the mail notification` that he have assigned a ticket.

- **Send Approval -** While `sending the approval` to the user, the `user will receive the mail notification` that he received a approval request for the ticket.

- **Close -** When the `ticket closed`, the ticket `created person will receive the mail notification`, that his ticket has been closed.

- **ReOpen -** When the ticket is closed but issue not fixed, the customer can `reopen ticket manually` by Reopen action button or `reply to the ticket mail` when the ticket is closed, it will automatically reopen the ticket.

- **Escalation Mail -** Once the ticket has been created in helpdesk via customer support, if that `ticket has not reviewed or not action taken untill 4 hours from ticket created`, the first `escalation mail notification will sent to the manager` of that department which the ticket is created under the category.

  If the ticket is still `not reviewed or not action taken untill 8 hours from ticket created`, the `second escalation mail notification` will sent to the manager again.
